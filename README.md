The HajjHackathon project for Team H-053


## The Problem

Crowed management is a very challenging issue that needs to be solved efficiently in order to meet vision 2030 goals of increasing the pilgrims number. The critical crowed management challenges are: 

The difficulty of collecting real-time data of pilgrims and vehicles flow in Hajj.

Pilgrims come from backgrounds and not everybody can access or use a smartphone. 

Locating and detecting suspicious activities and illegal pilgrims.

Locating and detecting missing/lost pilgrims with the current methods  


## The Solution

A real-time cloud software based on RFID, UHF, and drones; which will be used by Command and Control Centers (CCC).

Our software is also optimized as a smart phone app that could be used in the field by the government officials. 

Our software will be integrated with RFID tags placed on pilgrims and vehicles. "Localization"

Our software will be integrated with ground UHF long-range antennas for mass/flow monitoring. "Dedication" 

 Our software will be integrated with drone-mounted UHF readers for response and management. "Tracking"  

##Value Proposition: 

Accuracy and efficiency of collecting the pilgrims and traffic data compared to other data gathering methods. 

Active RFID tags have a very long battery life unlike smartphones, bluetooth bracelets, etc. 

Vision-based sensors can be integrated with our software and drones which potentially could be used for advanced command and control operations.

## What it does: 

Real-time crowd and traffic flow analysis.

Real-time tracking of pilgrims and vehicles. 

Locating lost pilgrims and their last status.

Detection of illegal pilgrims “ Aerial Geofences”.

Detection of suspicious activities.

Automated Violations detection.
